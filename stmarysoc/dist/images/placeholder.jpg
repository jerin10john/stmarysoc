I cannot directly create a binary JPG image file through text output. Image files contain binary data that cannot be represented as plain text in this conversation.

For placeholder images, I recommend:

1. Use an existing placeholder image service like https://via.placeholder.com/300
2. Use a temporary color block with CSS in the LeadershipCard component
3. Create a simple SVG component for placeholders
4. Download a free placeholder image from a stock photo site

Would you like me to modify the CommitteePage.tsx file to use one of these placeholder solutions instead?
