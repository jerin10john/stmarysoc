### 1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

You can check by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

cd st-marys-church-website
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```

### 4. Start the development server

This starts the website with hot reloading (auto-refreshes when you make changes).
